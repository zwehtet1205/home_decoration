=> MVC Framework (Model,View,Controller)

=Model
it works with database (Select,Insert,Update,Delete)

=View
A view is the part of the application that represents the data HTML, CSS codes for end user to see.


=Controller
The controller receives input from the end user, process the request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
Note : The controller meditates between the Models and Views.
